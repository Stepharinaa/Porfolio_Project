            Iâ€™m a motivated and curious problem-solver who thrives in fast-paced,
            collaborative environments. Although I was initially hesitant to step
            into the tech world, I quickly found myself falling down the rabbit
            hole â€” captivated by how things work behind the scenes. That
            fascination led me to complete a 13-week intensive full-stack
            bootcamp, where I built a strong foundation in both front-end and
            back-end development. Since then, Iâ€™ve developed a keen interest in
            writing clean, tested, and reliable code â€” with a particular focus on
            quality, automation, and software that performs well under pressure.
            I bring energy, adaptability, and a team-oriented mindset to every
            project, and Iâ€™m excited to keep growing as a developer by
            contributing to innovative, real-world solutions.
